This is a web application called "Stagini" that i've made in 48 hours in the Muhandis Hackthon Challenge (MHC)

This website is made using different technologies , bootstrap , html , css and js for the frontend , and Django python framework for the backend 

If you want to run it on your pc , you'll have to install python and django then you create a virtual environement and activate it
then put this folder in the venv and type these commands :
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py runserver

And hopefully you will see the results !
